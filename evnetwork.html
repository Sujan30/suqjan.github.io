<h2> Tesla Model S Plaid</h2>

<img src="https://www.thedrive.com/content-b/message-editor%2F1631057008777-inlineb.jpg?quality=60"> 
<p> The tesla Model S Plaid is now one of the fastest car a person can buy. What makes it special is the fact that it is an electric car. Not only does it go 0-60 in 1.99 seconds (with special tires),
    it can accomodate up to 5 people. The price? Starts at $123,740. Tesla is changing the car industry, usually if you would want to buy the fastest car (calculated by 0-60 time) you would have to be ready
    to spend atleast a million dollars. The common arguement is that the model S plaid is an electric vehicle, which is a fair arguement. And it can't really be used as an arguement, because most the people buy a tesla know its an electric vehicle. 
    Further specs of the car:
    <ul>
        <li> Horse Power: 1,020</li>
        <li> 0-60mph: 1.99 seconds (with special tires) 2.07 seconds (with no modification)</li>
        <li> Torque: 1050 lb-ft  </li>
        <li> 0-100 mph: 4.7 seconds</li>
        <li> top speed: 200mph</li>
    </ul>

<p> WORK IN PROGRESS stay tuned!</p>
